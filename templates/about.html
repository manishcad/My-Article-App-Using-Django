    <p>I have been published or featured in over 50 of the biggest newspapers, magazines, and television/radio shows on the planet, including: <em>New York Magazine</em>, <em>GQ</em>, the <em>Guardian</em>, the <em>BBC</em>, <em>Time Magazine</em>, the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>New York Post</em>, <em>USA Today</em>, <em>Buzzfeed</em>, <em>Vice</em>, and <em>Variety</em>, among many others.</p>
    <h3>What Makes My Work Different?</h3>
    <p>I am not your typical self-help “guru.” In fact, much of what I write about flies in the face of conventional self-help advice:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Pain is inevitable. </strong>There’s no such thing as a life without struggle. The key is to find meaningful struggle.</li>
    <li><strong>Positive thinking is overrated. </strong>Negative emotions serve a purpose. They can help us learn and grow and survive.</li>
    <li><strong>We are inherently flawed and limited. </strong>Better to learn and work with those limitations rather than be delusional and pretend they aren’t there.</li>
    <li><strong>Better to not know who we are. </strong>It&#8217;s when we get attached to our identity that bad things start to happen. Better to stay fluid and leave oneself open to growing and evolving.</li>
    <li><strong>There is no greater purpose or higher truth. </strong>It’s our responsibility to invent a sense of purpose for ourselves.</li>
    <li><strong>Meaningful change is, by definition, uncomfortable. </strong>This shit is not a weekend retreat.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This message of &#8220;negative self-help&#8221; has resonated with millions of people all over the world, attracting a growing community of readers and viewers who are committed to a more practical, realistic form of personal growth.</p>
